# Truck Scheduling for Foodstuffs

Foodstuffs, New Zealand's biggest grocery distributor, are looking to find the best trucking routes to deliver pallets of goods such that transportation costs are minimised. Methods such as analysing data provided by Foodstuffs to establish pallet demands, applying several assumptions and simplifications to generate feasible routes and formulating a mixed-integer program were used to find the optimal routing schedule for weekdays and Saturdays, which were then visualised through maps. This resulted in costs of $10123.47 and $5387.99 per day to deliver all required pallets for weekdays and Saturdays respectively. 

## Getting Started

Open the 'Final Report.pdf' file for the full report. To run the entire formulation and find the optimal routes, run 'LPFormulation.py'. The csv files are required for running this formulation.
